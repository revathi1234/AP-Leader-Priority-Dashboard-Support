# Project Report: AP Leader Priority Dashboard Support

## Objective:
This project aimed to develop a comprehensive Tableau dashboard, integrating data from Google BigQuery and external sources, to analyze success metrics and theft input portal statistics. The goal was to support strategic planning for AP field leaders in reducing shrink and optimizing store coverage.

## Methodology:
Utilizing advanced SQL queries and data integration from Google BigQuery and external sources, a dynamic and interactive Tableau dashboard was built. This facilitated the analysis of success metrics (top recovery cashiers and articles by store) and theft input portal statistics (theft and fraud activity by day and hour).


The project methodology encompassed several pivotal stages:

Data Aggregation and Processing: Gathering diverse datasets from multiple sources across the organization, ensuring data accuracy, and preparing it for integration within the Tableau dashboard.

Dashboard Interface Design: Utilizing Tableau's functionalities to design an engaging and user-friendly dashboard interface. This involved selecting appropriate visualization techniques, creating interactive elements, and ensuring the dashboard's responsiveness.

Integration of Key Metrics: Incorporating crucial KPIs and performance metrics identified by leadership into the dashboard to offer a holistic view of the AP region's performance and priorities.

Testing and Refinement: Iterative testing and feedback collection from stakeholders to refine the dashboard's usability and relevance, ensuring alignment with leadership requirements.

## Key Components:

### Success Metrics Analysis: 
Highlighted top recovery cashiers and articles by store to recognize effective strategies in shrink reduction.
### Theft Input Portal Statistics: 
Monitored theft and fraud activities by day and hour, aiding in scheduling AP field teams for optimal store coverage.

## Goal Achievement:

### Strategic Planning Support: 
The dashboard provided insights for strategic planning related to shrink reduction programs, emphasizing front-end recoveries and theft input portal escalations.
### Recognition and Performance Measures: 
Supported recognition and performance measures for AP field leaders, showcasing successes and opportunities for improvement.

## Timeframe:
The dashboard supported insights covering various historical periods, enabling the highlighting of success stories and opportunities in executing shrink reduction programs.

## Solution Implemented:

The dynamic and interactive Tableau dashboard seamlessly integrated data from Google BigQuery and external sources, facilitating the visualization and analysis of success and monitor metrics. Advanced SQL queries enabled efficient data processing and visualization.

This project establishes a foundation for AP field leaders to leverage data-driven insights for strategic planning, performance recognition, and effective shrink reduction programs within their stores.
