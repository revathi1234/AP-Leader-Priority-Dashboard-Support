# AP-Leader-Priority-Dashboard-Support
Analyzing success metrics (like top recovery cashiers and articles by store) and monitoring theft input portal statistics (such as theft and fraud activity by day and hour) guides scheduling AP field teams effectively. This ensures optimal store coverage and measures activity in staffed versus non-staffed APS stores.


Goal: To build a foundation to support strategic planning, recognition and performance measures related to AP shrink reduction programs for AP field leaders to leverage for success.

Timeframe: Support data insights that can be sourced for various historical periods to highlight opportunities and successes with store execution on shrink reduction programs such as front-end recoveries as well as theft input portal escalations.

Solution: The solution involves building a dynamic and interactive Tableau dashboard by integrating data from Google BigQuery and external data sources using advanced SQL queries. This synergy enables the visualization and analysis of success and monitor metrics.
